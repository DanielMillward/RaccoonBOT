This is an implementation of the Counterfactual Regret Minimization algorithm, inspired by [this paper](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~dturaev/neller-lanctot.pdf) published at the Imperial College London. The paper covers an implementation of both Tic-Tac-Toe and Kuhn Poker, the latter of which is what this program is capable of solving. Several of my other repos cover a similar space - feel free to poke around!
